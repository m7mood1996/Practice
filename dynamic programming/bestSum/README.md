# BestSum problem

Write a function 'bestSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return as array containing the shortest combination of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is a tie fot the shortest combination that adds up to the targetSum, then return any one of the shortest.

If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.
